 Groupie Trackers consists on receiving a given API and manipulate the data contained in it, in order to create a site, displaying the information.


# Starting the Server [localhost:8080]
By typing in terminal "go run main.go or go run ."

Usage
Endpoints:

"/" GET

"/response" POST

# To Do:

It will be given an API that consists in four parts:

. The first one, teams containing information about some players like their name(s), image off teams or players, in which year they began they signed, the date of their first fixture and goal.

. The second one, locations, consists in their last and/or upcoming fixtures locations.

. The third one, dates, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert dates.

. And the last one, relation, does the link between all the other parts, artists, dates and locations.

Given all this you should build a user friendly website where you can display the bands info through several data visualizations (examples : blocks, cards, tables, list, pages, graphics, etc). It is up to you to decide how you will display it.

This project also focuses on the creation of events/actions and on their visualization.

The event/action we want you to do is known as a client call to the server (client-server). We can say it is a feature of your choice that needs to trigger an action. This action must communicate with the server in order to recieve information, ([request-response])(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response)

An event consists in a system that responds to some kind of action triggered by the client, time, or any other factor.# premierleague-tracker
